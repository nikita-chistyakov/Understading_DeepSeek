📌 **DeepSeek R1: A Different approach to LLM**

├── 1️⃣ **Introduction**
│   ├── **DeepSeek R1** is a newly released (20/1/25) large language model (LLM) froma start-up in China.
│   ├── It performs **similarly to OpenAI’s GPT-4 01** in reasoning tasks like:
│   │   ├── Math
│   │   ├── Coding
│   │   ├── Scientific reasoning
│   ├── Costs $2.19 for million of tokens vs $60 OpenAI costs.
│   ├── Below are **three key takeaways** from DeepSeek R1’s research paper.

├── 2️⃣ **Key Concept 1: Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning**
│   ├── **Definition**: A technique where the model is prompted to **think step by step**.
│   ├── **How It Works**:
│   │   ├── The model explains its reasoning as it solves problems.
│   │   ├── If it makes an error, users can pinpoint the mistake and correct it.
│   │   ├── This iterative process helps improve **accuracy** and **self-reflection**.
│   ├── **Example**:
│   │   ├── Given a math problem, the model outlines its steps and self-checks.
│   │   ├── It highlights "aha" moments and reevaluates answers when needed.
│   │   ├── Results in more reliable outputs compared to direct answer generation.

├── 3️⃣ **Key Concept 2: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Self-Guided Learning**
│   ├── **How It Differs from Standard Training**:
│   │   ├── Instead of feeding the model predefined questions & answers, it **learns by exploration**.
│   │   ├── Similar to how a **baby learns to walk**—trial and error with continuous feedback.
│   ├── **Application in DeepSeek R1**:
│   │   ├── The model optimizes its **policy** (decision-making behavior).
│   │   ├── Tries different approaches to **maximize rewards**.
│   │   ├── Over time, it identifies the most **efficient** problem-solving strategies.
│   ├── **Example**:
│   │   ├── Multiple ways to solve an equation exist.
│   │   ├── The model learns which method is the most **efficient** (shortest steps, highest reward).
│   ├── **Performance Gains**:
│   │   ├── Unlike OpenAI’s GPT-4 01 (static model), DeepSeek R1 **keeps improving** as it trains.
│   │   ├── The model **self-reflects** using Chain of Thought to fine-tune its responses.

├── 4️⃣ **Key Concept 3: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**
│   ├── **What It Does**:
│   │   ├── Measures how well the model’s new responses **compare** to its old responses.
│   │   ├── Helps the model **optimize its policy** for better accuracy.
│   │   ├── Prevents extreme fluctuations in learning (ensures **stable training**).
│   ├── **Core Mechanism**:
│   │   ├── Uses **weighted averages** to balance learning speed and accuracy.
│   │   ├── Applies **clipping and standardization** to avoid over-adjustments.
│   ├── **Real-World Benefit**:
│   │   ├── Ensures gradual and **stable improvements** in reasoning ability.

├── 5️⃣ **Key Concept 4: Model Distillation for Accessibility**
│   ├── **Problem**:
│   │   ├── Full DeepSeek R1 model has **671 Billion parameters**.
│   │   ├── Requires massive computational resources (thousands of GPUs).
│   ├── **Solution: Model Distillation**:
│   │   ├── Uses the large model to **train a smaller model of about 7 Billion parameters**.
│   │   ├── Smaller model (e.g., Llama 3) mimics the reasoning process of DeepSeek R1.
│   │   ├── Makes high-performance AI **more accessible**.
│   ├── **Findings**:
│   │   ├── Distilled models **outperformed larger models** like GPT-4 01 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
│   │   ├── Achieved competitive results in **math, coding, and scientific reasoning**.

├── 6️⃣ **Conclusion**
│   ├── **DeepSeek R1's Advantages**:
│   │   ├── Uses **self-reflection and reinforcement learning** to improve accuracy.
│   │   ├── Applies **policy optimization** to enhance learning stability.
│   │   ├── Leverages **model distillation** for wider accessibility.
│   ├── **Implications**:
│   │   ├── Shows promise in **scalable AI training** without massive resource needs.
│   │   ├── Could **bridge the gap** between high-end and consumer AI models.
│   ├── **Next Steps**:
│   │   ├── Read the full research paper (https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf).
│   │   ├── Test DeepSeek R1 on **Hugging Face** or other AI platforms.
